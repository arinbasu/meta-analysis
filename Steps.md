## Steps of Meta Analysis

* Framing of Research Qeustion
* Searching he Literature
* First Pass by Title and Abstract
* Obtain Full texts of articles
* Conduct Hand Search
* Appraise critically for risk of bias
* Find out if the articles show homogeneity of variation
* Pool the results of the studies (fixed effects or randome effects)
* Conduct sensitivity analyses

## Framing of Research Question

The study questions are framed using the participant-intervention-comparator-outcomes (PICO) format. In the PICO format, the participants refer to individuals who take part in the study (thus self explanatory), the term “intervention” refer to the specific experiment or the drugs or devices that are done to the those who take part in the study, the comparator groups specifically refer to those individuals who were on the placebo arm or the usual care arm for the study, and the outcomes refer to the specific outcomes that a researcher is interested to study in the meta analysis. 

This scheme allows for some variations. In meta analyses of observational studies, instead of intervention, researchers study natural experiments, also known as exposure, so the PICO framework then gets converted into PECO framework.
